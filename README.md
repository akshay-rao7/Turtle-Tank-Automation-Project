# Turtle-Tank-Automation-Project

### Turtles no doubt they are very cute and adorable, maintaining their tub/auarium/pond would be one heck of a task. The water gets murkier and starts to stink. I faced similar problem at my home and hence I came up with this idea of creating an automated solution to tackle this problem.

### Following are the links of the video which I have uploaded on Youtube.
